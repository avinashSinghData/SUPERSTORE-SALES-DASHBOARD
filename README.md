# SUPERSTORE-SALES-FORECAST-DASHBOARD

**Problem Statement:**
Sales data from US Superstore contains insights across regions, product categories, and payment methods, but raw data is hard to interpret. This dashboard summarizes historical sales trends and provides a 15-day forecast to help optimize inventory, sales strategies, and business planning.

**Approach:**
Cleaned and structured the Superstore sales dataset.
Analyzed sales by region, payment type, and product category to uncover patterns.
Designed a 2-page interactive dashboard:
Page 1: Overview and detailed sales analysis
Page 2: 15-day sales forecast with predictive insights
Generated actionable recommendations based on historical trends and forecasted performance.

**Key Insights / Outcomes**
Certain regions drive the majority of sales; marketing and inventory can be prioritized accordingly.
Payment method distribution indicates preferred transaction types per region.
High-selling categories are consistent, but low-performing categories can be optimized.
